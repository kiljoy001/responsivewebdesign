            <p>
                    Crunchyroll is an American distributor, publisher, and licensing company focused on streaming anime, manga, and drama. Founded in 2006 by a group of University of California, Berkeley graduates, Crunchyroll's distribution channel and partnership program delivers content to over 35 million online community members worldwide. Crunchyroll is a subsidiary of Otter Media, which is a subsidiary of AT&T's WarnerMedia. Crunchyroll has offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chișinău and Tokyo, and is a member of the Association of Japanese Animations (AJA).

                    Crunchyroll offers over 900 anime shows, more than 200 Asian dramas to users, and 50 manga titles, although not all programming is available worldwide due to licensing restrictions. In February 2017, Crunchyroll passed one million paid subscribers. Crunchyroll also selects some anime titles for release on Blu-ray/DVD through its distribution partners (Funimation in the United States, Anime Limited in the United Kingdom).

                I think this site suffers a bit in the navigation department. One of my biggest complaints after using this site for years is that when it comes to seeing the latest episodes they are all the way at the bottom if they are not in the simulcast lineup. Another annoyance is the featured shows list which seems to get updated very infrequently, and it's not clear what if anything is a featured show. The main purpose of the site is to show multimedia video, so anything like news, forum post updates, should, in my opinion, be placed on another page to free up valuable real estate for more video links. I just feel the layout is in desperate need of a refresh, and it should clean up a lot of the unnecessary clutter on the main page. While the site does have a help/faq link it's all the way at the bottom and very small. It's pretty clear that they are not aware of or following any of the best practices in the article.

                This site is not responsive. Changing the width of the site makes the user have to scroll widthwise to see the content. When I try to change my user agent to a mobile one, it just redirects to a page telling you to download their mobile application. This is a clear case where a PWA (progressive web application) would have been the best thing to do here. They do have a lot of different applications for many platforms, and I wonder if using a PWA would have streamlined this overall and gave the desktop site a refresh

            <h2 id="content">Content</h2>
            <p>
                    The content here is always fresh. Because they are in the business of simultaneously showing anime shows broadcasting in Japan online, every day of the week there is typically an update of some sort. They also update the news section frequently on the front page as well. The design of the site does serve it's the purpose, but I think they can do better to organize the videos.

            <p>
                The site is very easy to use if you are looking for the latest shows. For their back catalog, I think there are some improvements that could be made possible. One of the biggest problems I think is that by default the videos are shown by popularity vs alphabetical or genre. When you are looking for something that could have come out a year or two back, it can be quite frustrating to scroll endlessly down to try to look what you are looking for. Granted those options do exist, however, I typically forget about them and then start scrolling down. To me, it would appear that other people would do this too instead of using the organizational links. I suppose what I am saying here is: why make it hard? Just make it easy the first time around and let users peruse the large catalog you have easily. When it comes to the videos playback, I've never had much trouble. A few years back the video player they used was a bit weird but now it's very much like youtube with an automatic quality adjuster making for easy playback that will match the quality to your available bandwidth.

                I've made a variety of suggestions thus far, so I won't repeat them here. Overall the site needs to be updated.

                <h2 id="purpose">Digg</h2>
                <p>
                    Digg is a news aggregator with a curated front page, aiming to select stories specifically for the Internet audience such as science, trending political issues, and viral Internet issues. It was launched in its current form on July 31, 2012, with support for sharing content to other social platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

                    It formerly had been a popular social news website, allowing people to vote web content up or down, called digging and burying, respectively. In 2012, Quantcast estimated Digg's monthly U.S. unique visits at 3.8 million. Digg's popularity prompted the creation of similar social networking sites with story submission and voting systems such as Reddit.
                        
                    In July 2008, the former company took part in advanced acquisition talks with Google for a reported $200 million price tag, but the deal ultimately fell through. After a controversial 2010 redesign and the departure of co-founders Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose, in July 2012 Digg was sold in three parts: the Digg brand, website and technology were sold to Betaworks for an estimated $500,000; 15 staff were transferred to The Washington Post's "SocialCode" for a reported $12 million; and a suite of patents was sold to LinkedIn for about $4 million.
                        
                    In September 2016, Digg announced that it would begin a data partnership with Gannett. The "seven figure" investment would give Gannett access to real-time trend analysis of Digg's 7.5 million pieces of content.
                        
                    In March 2018, Digg announced that it would shut down its RSS reader, Digg Reader. Digg was purchased by BuySellAds, an advertising company, for an undisclosed amount in April 2018.

                    The navigation of the site is simple as it uses a card based layout that responds to the screen width for phones, tablets & desktop.

                <p>
                    The content is updated about twice a day (it could be more but I'm not sure). I think the simple design focuses on the content rather than the site itself. Instead of distracting users with a forum like an experience (like slashdot) it focuses on the actual news which is a bit different.  In previous versions, it did have a forum, but it did away with it and focused on the news instead.

                <p>
                    This site doesn't have much in the interactive department. It really keeps it simple. It has more in common with a site that lists news links with some pictures than a web application. I suppose for people like me, I like the curation of the stories as they are typically not found anywhere else unless it's a major event of some sort. It gives me the feeling of a newspaper without the subscription.

                <h2 id="purpose">Slashdot</h2>
                <p>
                    Slashdot (sometimes abbreviated as /.) is a social news website that originally billed itself as "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters". It features news stories on science, technology, and politics that are submitted and evaluated by site users and editors. Each story has a comments section attached to it where users can add online comments. The website was founded in 1997 by Hope College students Rob Malda, also known as "CmdrTaco", and classmate Jeff Bates, also known as "Hemos". In 2012, they sold it to[4] DHI Group, Inc. (i.e., Dice Holdings International, which created the Dice.com website for tech job seekers[5][6]). In January 2016, BizX acquired Slashdot Media, including both slashdot.org and SourceForge.[1][7][8]

                    Summaries of stories and links to news articles are submitted by Slashdot's own users, and each story becomes the topic of a threaded discussion among users. Discussion is moderated by a user-based moderation system. Randomly selected moderators are assigned points (typically 5) which they can use to rate a comment. Moderation applies either −1 or +1 to the current rating, based on whether the comment is perceived as either "normal", "offtopic", "insightful", "redundant", "interesting", or "troll" (among others).
                        
                    The site's comment and moderation system is administered by its own open source content management system, Slash, which is available under the GNU General Public License. In 2012, Slashdot had around 3.7 million unique visitors per month and received over 5300 comments per day.[5] The site has won more than 20 awards, including People's Voice Awards in 2000 for "Best Community Site" and "Best News Site". At its peak use, a news story posted to the site with a link could overwhelm some smaller or independent sites. This phenomenon was known as the "Slashdot effect".
