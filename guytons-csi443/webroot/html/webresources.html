			Bootstrap provides an easy to use base on which to start your responsive web site. It uses a mixture of Javascript and CSS to style and organize your site pages. In addition to styling pages, it also allows an easy way to make your site mobile ready with fluid page resizing. Mastering bootstrap will easily make your sites look more professional, as the built in grid structure give much more ease in making your sites look good.

			<a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a><br />
			Your starting point for all things Angular. Angular is a Javascript framework for building responsive websites. It specializes in single page applications by the use of the MVC or MVVM pattern. Perhaps the greatest section of the site for resources is the documentation section that will give the official documentation on how to use Angular to accomplish your goals. With Angular you are able to create complex single page applications without having to create large amounts of html webpages.  Additionally with the modular features of Angular, you can easily extend and add features as needed.

One of the more interesting features is that there are groups you can find through Facebook or Meetup that will engage in collaborative study
